Open issues:
[ ] Strategy for animation-types (auto?)
[ ] iOS clipping when content is entirely not visible
[ ] iOS border-radius clipping (parent clipping)
[ ] iOS Compound view "fade" issue
[ ] Android backgroundImage support
[ ] Android FastImage support
[ ] Android inverted scrollview clipping
[ ] Android image resizeMode mode & border-radius drawing artefact
[ ] Android scale transform support
[ ] Android elevation-shadow & clip artefact
[ ] Android clip doesn't work correctly when border-radius is used

Would be nice:
[ ] Show / hide animations
[ ] Show / hide animations on Shared Element renderer
[ ] Better image fade
[ ] Web support
[ ] Blur radius

Probably not:
[ ] react-native-photo-view
