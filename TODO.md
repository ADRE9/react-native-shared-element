Essential:
[ ] Clipping doesn't work when not visible at all
[ ] Parent clipping with border-radii
[X] Image resizeMode other than 'cover'
[X] ImageBackground support
[X] Scrollview clipping
[X] visibleLayout issue when scene is offsetted outside the screen  
[ ] Compound view "fade" issue
[ ] Android support
[ ] Show / hide animations
[ ] Show / hide animations on Shared Element renderer

Would be nice:
[ ] Web support
[-] Non-native implementation



Android problems so far:
- [X] Getting to the underlying (image) content (intrinsic size is required for proper animation)
- [ ] Getting to the border color/width/style
- [ ] Getting to the resizeMode (ScaleType)
- [ ] Background color?
- [ ] Draw requires Scale transform
- [ ] Blur-radius?
